title: _In Search of Lost Time_ Book Club
---

## Who? 
- You and anyone you'd like to invite!

## What?
- A casual discussion of Marcel Proust's _In Search of Lost Time_
- "A novel in seven volumes by French author Marcel Proust," it "follows the narrator's recollections of childhood and experiences into adulthood in the late 19th-century and early 20th-century high-society France, while reflecting on the loss of time and lack of meaning in the world." -- Wikipedia
- We will start with Volume 1, _Swann's Way_

## When? 
- (Tentative) Volume 1 Meeting 1, covering Overture + Combray: 7:30pm PST on Sunday August 28th 
- (Tentative) Volume 1 Meeting 2, covering remainder of Volume 1: 7:30pm PST on Sunday September 10th

## Where?
- On Zoom! Link: TBD
- In person! At Sruthi & Keyhan's place on Dolores (thematically appropriate refreshments, i.e. madeleines and tea, will be served) 

## Why? 
- This person on TikTok [made a good case for it](https://www.tiktok.com/t/ZTRUS56vF/?k=1)
- It's gay!
- The clout of reading something like _Infinite Jest_ or _A Little  Life_ but the author is less cancelled
- It's referenced in _A Tale for the Time Being_, _1Q84_, and _Gilmore Girls_
- Endorsed by Vladimir Nabokov and Virgina Woolf

## How? 
- We will use the C. K. Scott Moncrieff translation (but feel free to read it in the original French, or translated to another language)
- You can get the book to read online, for Kindle, or as an EPUB from [Project Gutenberg](https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7178)

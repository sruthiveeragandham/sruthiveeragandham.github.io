Hello! I'm Sruthi Veeragandham. I'm currently finishing up my last semester as an undergraduate at the University of California, Berkeley, where I'm a Microbial Biology major and Computer Science minor. I'll be graduating in December 2019, after which I'll be working as a software engineer.

For the last year [I've been a TA](/teaching) for UC Berkeley's introductory machine structures course, [CS 61C](https://cs61c.org). Before switching gears towards computer science, I spent a couple years as a research assistant in the [Coleman-Derr Lab](https://pgec.berkeley.edu/coleman-derr-lab-0), which studies the root microbiome of drought-stressed cereal crops. In Summer 2019, I was in New York City, working as a software engineering intern on the embedded systems team at [Andium](https://andium.com). 

Outside of school, I'm one of the facilitators of an amazing Girls Who Code club at the Cesar Chavez Library (check out one of our projects from Spring 2019 [here](https://gwc-ca9717.github.io)). Please feel free to send any girls you know in 6th to 12th grade our way!

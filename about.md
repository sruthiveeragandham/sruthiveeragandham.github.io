title: About Me
---

Hello! I'm Sruthi Veeragandham. I'm currently an undergraduate at the University of California, Berkeley, where I'm a Microbial Biology major and Computer Science minor. My primary interests lie in computer architecture and low-level systems. I'll be graduating in December 2019! 

I'm currently in New York City, working as a software engineering intern on the embedded systems team at [Andium](https://andium.com). 

Back in Berkeley, for the last year [I've been a TA](/teaching) for UC Berkeley's introductory machine structures course, [CS 61C](https://cs61c.org). Before switching gears towards computer science, I also spent a couple years as a research assistant in the [Coleman-Derr Lab](https://pgec.berkeley.edu/coleman-derr-lab-0), which studies the root microbiome of drought-stressed cereal crops. 

In spring 2019, I was one of the facilitators of an amazing Girls Who Code club at the Cesar Chavez Library (check out one of our projects [here](https://gwc-ca9717.github.io)). We'll be back this fall--please feel free to send any girls you know in 6th to 12th grade our way! In my spare time, I enjoy jogging and reading science fiction (I'm a huge fan of Ursula K. LeGuin, Octavia Butler, Ted Chiang, Cixin Liu & Joanna Russ).

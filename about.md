title: About Me
---

Hello! I'm Sruthi Veeragandham. In December 2019, I graduated from the University of California, Berkeley, where I majored in Microbial Biology and minored in Computer Science. After graduating, I worked as a software engineer until Fall 2023, when I switched gears and decided to get my EMT license. I currently work as a medical scribe at Marin Community Clinics. 

In my last year at Berkeley, [I was a TA](/teaching) for UC Berkeley's introductory machine structures course, [CS 61C](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs61c/fa19/). I also spent a couple years as a research assistant in the [Coleman-Derr Lab](https://pgec.berkeley.edu/coleman-derr-lab-0), which studies the root microbiome of drought-stressed cereal crops.

While we had to disband for shelter in place in March 2020, I was one of the facilitators of an amazing Girls Who Code club at the Cesar Chavez Library -- check out one of our projects from Spring 2019 [here](https://gwc-ca9717.github.io). And if you live in Alameda County, I highly encourage you to get involved in the movement for Care First, Jails Last -- read an op-ed I co-authored about it [here](https://ellabakercenter.medium.com/during-mental-health-awareness-month-alameda-county-supervisors-have-an-opportunity-to-affirm-c0fe0b86377a).
